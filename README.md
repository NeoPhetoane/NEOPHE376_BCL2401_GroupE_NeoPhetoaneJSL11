**Overview:**

The task recording application is built using JavaScript and offers features like categorizing tasks into boards, tracking different completion statuses, and providing options for both dark and light themes. Additionally, the application stores user preferences and task data for seamless refreshing.

**Reflection**

**Areas of Mastery**

Functions: I've become adept at creating efficient functions and calling them appropriately within the application's logic.

Syntax: Working so much with JavaScript syntax has improved my ability to debug code and write functions with clarity. I've found it beneficial to easily add event listeners, fetch elements, and convert them into variables.

User Interface: Consideration for user efficiency has guided decisions around task deletion, data retention, and ease of navigation within the application. This focus on user experience has enhanced the overall usability of the interface.

If/Else Statements: Utilizing conditional statements has allowed me to manage different options effectively, such as toggling the visibility of the sidebar and switching between light and dark themes. 

**Challenges Faced:**

Debugging: Debugging proved challenging as it required careful analysis of functions to understand their behavior before identifying and resolving errors.

Creating Functions: Since most of our projects prior to this were based on debugging, creating functions from scratch and referencing helper functions was difficult. 

**Areas for Improvement:**

Modal Functionality: Enhancing the user experience by allowing users to exit the edit task modal by clicking anywhere outside of it, instead of relying solely on a cancel button, would improve usability.

Keyboard Accessibility: Enabling users to interact with the application using keyboard shortcuts, such as using the Enter key for selection and the Delete key for deletion, would streamline the user experience and cater to different preferences.

**Overall learning experience**


Developing this task recording application has been a valuable learning experience, enhancing my JavaScript skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of user-centric design. Through debugging challenges and independent work, I have gotten to inderstand JavaScript even more and gain a little emore confidence with it.
